//Explain this code
for(var i = 0; i < 16; i+=8){
	console.log(i);
}

// Count by 8 while (i) is less than 16
// 0 and 8 will print to the console

var str = "ahceclwlxo";
for (var i = 1; i < str.length; i += 2){
	console.log(str[i]);
}

//(str) starts at index 1 which is (h) and increments by 2. 
//(h-e-l-l-o) will be printed to the console.
